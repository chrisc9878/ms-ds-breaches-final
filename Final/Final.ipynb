    "# Cyber Security Breaches\n",
    "The dataset I choose was on the cyber security breaches involving health care records of 500 or more people reported to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as of June 27, 2014. The dataset contains 1055 observations with 13 variables: \n",
    "1.\t**Name of Covered Entity**: factor giving the name of the entity experiencing the breach\n",
    "2.\t**State**: Factor giving the 2-letter code of the state where the breach occurred. This has 52 levels for the 50 states plus the District of Columbia (DC) and Puerto Rico (PR).\n",
    "3.\t**Business Associate Involved**: Factor giving the name of a subcontractor (or blank) associated with the breach.\n",
    "4.\t**Individuals Affected**: integer number of humans whose records were compromised in the breach. This is 500 or greater; U.S. law requires reports of breaches involving 500 or more records but not of breaches involving fewer.\n",
    "5.\t**Date of Breach**: character vector giving the date or date range of the breach. Recodes as Dates in breach_start and breach_end.\n",
    "6.\t**Type of Breach**: factor with 29 levels giving the type of breach (e.g., \"Theft\" vs. \"Unauthorized Access/Disclosure\", etc.)\n",
    "7.\t**Location of Breached Information**: factor with 41 levels coding the location from which the breach occurred (e.g., \"Paper\", \"Laptop\", etc.)\n",
    "8.\t**Date Posted or Updated**: Date the information was posted to the HHS data base or last updated.\n",
    "9.\t**Summary**: character vector of a summary of the incident.\n",
    "10.\t**Breach Start**: Date of the start of the incident = first date given in Date_of_Breach above.\n",
    "11.\t**Breach End**: Date of the end of the incident or NA if only one date is given in Date_of_Breach above. \n",
    "12.\t**Year**: integer giving the year of the breach"

The monetary payments of $4,800,000 include the largest HIPAA settlement to date.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) initiated its investigation of New York and Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) and Columbia University (CU) following their submission of a joint breach report, dated September 27, 2010, regarding the disclosure of the ePHI of 6,800 individuals, including patient status, vital signs, medications, and laboratory results. \\n\\nNYP and CU are separate covered entities that participate in a joint arrangement in which CU faculty members serve as attending physicians at NYP. The entities generally refer to their affiliation as 'New York Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.'  NYP and CU operate a shared data network and a shared network firewall that is administered by employees of both entities. The shared network links to NYP patient information systems containing ePHI.\\n\\nThe investigation revealed that the breach was caused when a physician employed by CU who developed applications for both NYP and CU attempted to deactivate a personally-owned computer server on the network containing NYP patient ePHI. Because of a lack of technical safeguards, deactivation of the server resulted in ePHI being accessible on internet search engines. The entities learned of the breach after receiving a complaint by an individual who found the ePHI of the individual's deceased partner, a former patient of NYP, on the internet.\\n\\nIn addition to the impermissible disclosure of ePHI on the internet, OCR's investigation found that neither NYP nor CU made efforts prior to the breach to assure that the server was secure and that it contained appropriate software protections. Moreover, OCR determined that neither entity had conducted an accurate and thorough risk analysis that identified all systems that access NYP ePHI. As a result, neither entity had developed an adequate risk management plan that addressed the potential threats and hazards to the security of ePHI. Lastly, NYP failed to implement appropriate policies and procedures for authorizing access to its databases and failed to comply with its own policies on information access management.\\n\\n'When entities participate in joint compliance arrangements, they share the burden of addressing the risks to protected health information,'  said Christina Heide, Acting Deputy Director of Health Information Privacy for OCR. 'Our cases against NYP and CU should remind health care organizations of the need to make data security central to how they manage their information systems.' \\n\\nNYP has paid OCR a monetary settlement of $3,300,000 and CU $1,500,000, with both entities agreeing to a substantive corrective action plan, which includes undertaking a risk analysis, developing a risk management plan, revising policies and procedures, training staff, and providing progress reports.\\n\\n\", \"Breach Start\": \"7/1/2010\", \"Breach End\": \"NA\", \"Year\": 2010}, {\"Name of Covered Entity\": \"St. James Hospital and Health Centers\", \"State\": \"IL\", \"Business Associate Involved\": \"NA\", \"Individuals Affected\": 967, \"Date of Breach\": \"8/10/2010\", \"Type of Breach\": \"Improper Disposal\", \"Location of Breached Information\": \"Paper\", \"Date Posted or Updated\": \"1/23/2014\", \"Summary\": \"NA\", \"Breach Start\": \"8/10/2010\", \"Breach End\": \"NA\", \"Year\": 2010}, {\"Name of Covered Entity\": \"University of Oklahoma - Tulsa, Neurology Clinic\", \"State\": \"OK\", \"Business Associate Involved\": \"NA\", \"Individuals Affected\": 19200, \"Date of Breach\": \"7/28/2010\", \"Type of Breach\": \"Hacking/IT Incident\", \"Location of Breached Information\": \"Desktop Computer\", \"Date Posted or Updated\": \"1/23/2014\", \"Summary\": \"NA\", \"Breach Start\": \"7/28/2010\", \"Breach End\": \"NA\", \"Year\": 2010}, {\"Name of Covered Entity\": \"LORENZO BROWN, MD INC.\", \"State\": \"CA\", \"Business Associate Involved\": \"NA\", \"Individuals Affected\": 928, \"Date of Breach\": \"8/17/2010\", \"Type of Breach\": \"Theft\", \"Location of Breached Information\": \"Desktop Computer\", \"Date Posted or Updated\": \"1/23/2014\", \"Summary\": \"NA\", \"Breach Start\": \"8/17/2010\", \"Breach End\": \"NA\", \"Year\": 2010}, {\"Name of Covered Entity\": \"Milton Pathology Associates, P.C.\", \"State\": \"MA\", \"Business Associate Involved\": \"Joseph A.

Upon discovery of the breach, the CE shut down all computer and email systems to prevent unauthorized access to its network and core files.  In addition, the CE decommissioned the previously used server, deactivated the network router, disabled network access to ePHI, and discontinued the previously utilized backup.  As a result of OCR's investigation, the CE deployed a new real-time firewall and intrusion detection system and implemented new measures for software management.  In addition, the CE installed a new network server, deployed a new router with security subscription to actively monitor internal network traffic and external threat patterns, and implemented a centralized antivirus software system.\", \"Breach Start\": \"11/15/2011\", \"Breach End\": \"12/14/2011\", \"Year\": 2011}, {\"Name of Covered Entity\": \"Memorial Healthcare System\", \"State\": \"FL\", \"Business Associate Involved\": \"NA\", \"Individuals Affected\": 9497, \"Date of Breach\": \"08/01/2011 - 02/12/2012\", \"Type of Breach\": \"Other\", \"Location of Breached Information\": \"Other\", \"Date Posted or Updated\": \"1/23/2014\", \"Summary\": \"NA\", \"Breach Start\": \"8/1/2011\", \"Breach End\": \"2/12/2012\", \"Year\": 2011}, {\"Name of Covered Entity\": \"Roy E.

    "### Recap of Goals & Tasks\n",
    "Why is a task pursued? (goal)\n",
    "- To communicate the information from a dataset in a way that is easy to understand the data  \n",
    "\n",
    "How is a task conducted? (means)\n",
    "- The task is conducted with Altair on the Jupyter notebook  \n",
    "\n",
    "What does a task seek to learn about the data? (characteristics)\n",
    "- Which from of breach affects the most individuals  \n",
    "\n",
    "Where does the task operate? (target data)\n",
    "- The tasks will operate in the absolute reference  \n",
    "\n",
    "When is the task performed? (workflow)\n",
    "- In the exploratory stage prior to building the model   \n",

    "Who is executing the task? (roles)\n",
    "- This will be executed by a student pursing a data science degree  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation \n",
    "The target questions you want to answer  \n",
    "* For the breach that had the greatest number of individuals affected what was the source (i.e., laptop, mobile device)?   \n",
    "* Which year had the highest increase in breaches by theft and what could have played a factor for this spike?    \n",
    "* Can improper disposal of computer equipment lead to a cybersecurity breach?    \n",
    "\n",
    "The people you would recruit to answer that question\n",
    "* I can ask the general public around my community as well as colleagues from work  \n",
    "\n",
    "The kinds of measures you would use to answer your data (e.g., insight depth, use cases, accuracy) and what these measures would tell you about the core question. \n",
    "* Participants would read the questions and use the visualizations to find the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach you will use to answer that question (e.g., a journaling study, a formal experiment, etc.) \n",
    "* I would use a journaling study to get what the participants have observed when going through the evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "How you would instantiate those methods (i.e., what would your participants do?)  \n",
    "* Those that have accepted to preform the survey of questions will use the created visuals to answer the questions mentioned earlier\n",
    "\n",
    "What criteria would you use to indicate that your visualization was successful?\n",
    "* If the participants can accurately answer the questions with the provided visuals \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "With my methods to create the visualizations I started off with getting the states with the highest number of affected individuals. The top three states were Virginia, California, and Illinois with 5110781, 4672091, 4402934 total individuals affected respectively. I then wanted to see which year had the highest spike in cybersecurity breaches by theft and this led to 2013 (peak was in the month of May). From this data only there is no concrete evidence to understand why this year had such an uptick in breaches. And lastly improper disposal of computer equipment has contributed to breaches that have affected a total of 671,594 individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "From my evaluations I received some feedback as to how I can make the visuals just a little bit better by adding some interactions for users to “play with the data view” and to remove the redundant data in respect to the types of data breach. What worked well was the simple data tables that consisted of state, individuals affected, and type of breach. The line plot to show the historical timeline of security breaches got more positive reviews than I initial thought from the participants. In closing, I found this feedback to be great and will further make refinements to the data visualizations with more evaluations. "
